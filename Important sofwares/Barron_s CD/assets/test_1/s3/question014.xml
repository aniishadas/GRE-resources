<p>In 2005, 80% of the Central City School Districts total expenditures came from local property taxes, and the rest came from the state governmentâ€™s Aid to Schools Program. If the state had reduced its aid to the district by 50%, by what percentage would local property taxes have had to be increased in order for the district to maintain the same level of expenditures?</p>

<p lineHeight="32">Surprisingly, the answer to this question does not depend on the data in the charts. Of every $100 that the district spent in 2005, $80 came from the local taxes and $20 came from the state. Had the state reduced its aid to the district by half (50%), the state would have reduced its contribution by $10. To compensate for that, the district would have had to increase the portion paid by taxes by $10, from $80 to $90. This represents an increase of  <img dominantBaseline="ideographicCenter" source="assets/images/tst1_eqn_048.swf"/> &#215; 100% = 12.5%.</p>
