<p><span fontWeight="bold">indicate the word is being used in an ironic sense.</span></p>
<p>The author of the passage has already indicated his dissatisfaction with the magic-loving, metaphor-using school of historical writing that obscures more than it illuminates. Clearly, he is using the word "poetic" <span fontStyle="italic">in an ironic sense.</span></p>
<p><span fontStyle="italic">Emphasize the triteness of the term</span> is incorrect. Nothing in the passage suggests that the term <span fontStyle="italic">poetic</span> is hackneyed or trite as a description of this school of historical writing.</p>
<p><span fontStyle="italic">Identify the use of a colloquialism</span> is incorrect. Nothing in the passage suggests that the term <span fontStyle="italic">poetic</span> is a <span fontStyle="italic">colloquialism</span> or informal, conversational expression.</p>
<p><span fontStyle="italic">Point out the inspirational quality of this school of writing</span> is incorrect.  Nothing in this passage suggests that the author finds this school of writing particularly <span fontStyle="italic">inspirational </span>or moving.</p>
<p><span fontStyle="italic">Imply that the historians involved wrote in verse</span> is incorrect. Nothing in the passage suggests that this school of historical writing ever produced anything in verse.</p>
