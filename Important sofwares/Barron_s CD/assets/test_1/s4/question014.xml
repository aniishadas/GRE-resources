<p><span fontWeight="bold">monomaniacs.</span></p>
<p><span fontStyle="italic">Monomaniacs</span> are people who concentrate excessively on a single object. In this case, the excessively zealous American wine-lovers are considered <span fontStyle="italic">monomaniacs</span> by their European counterparts, who are less obsessive in their appreciation of wine.</p>
<p><span fontStyle="italic">Artisans</span> is incorrect. <span fontStyle="italic">Artisans</span> are skilled manual workers. The term is inappropriate in the context.</p>
<p><span fontStyle="italic">Hypocrites </span>is incorrect. <span fontStyle="italic">Hypocrites </span>are people who pretend to possess some virtue or skill, but who are faking it. American wine-lovers, however, are not faking their love for wine; they are "zealous and somewhat narrow-minded converts" to the wine-lovers’ religion.</p>
<p><span fontStyle="italic">Reprobates </span>is incorrect. <span fontStyle="italic">Reprobates</span> are unprincipled, wicked people. The term makes no sense in the context.</p>
<p><span fontStyle="italic">Surrogates</span> is incorrect. <span fontStyle="italic">Surrogates</span> are people who take other’s places, substituting for them. The term makes no sense in the context.</p>
