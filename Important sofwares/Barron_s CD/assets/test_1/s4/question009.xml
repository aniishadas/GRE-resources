<p><span fontWeight="bold">It moved from a Marxist-Leninist dictatorship to a military government.</span></p>
<p>According to the passage, Benin actually abandoned the military governmental structure back in 1972.</p>
<p><span fontStyle="italic">It underwent a transition from a nonrepresentative form of government to a representative form</span> is incorrect.  Benin <span fontStyle="italic">made the first successful transfer of power in Africa from a dictatorship to a democracy</span>. Therefore, it is true that the country <span fontStyle="italic">underwent a transition from a nonrepresentative form of government to a representative form.</span></p>
<p><span fontStyle="italic">There were periodic allegations that the electoral system had been compromised</span> is incorrect.  According to the passage, <span fontStyle="italic">some irregularities</span> were alleged in the elections of 1996 and 2001. Thus, there clearly <span fontStyle="italic">were periodic allegations that the electoral system had been compromised</span> (made vulnerable to suspicion; jeopardized).</p>
<p><span fontStyle="italic">It was noteworthy for its transformation from a dictatorship to a popular democracy</span> is incorrect. The passage states that Benin <span fontStyle="italic">made the first successful transfer of power in Africa from a dictatorship to a democracy</span>. Clearly such a transformation <span fontStyle="italic">was noteworthy for </span>the government.</p>
<p><span fontStyle="italic">The country’s first president had previously served as its prime minister</span> is incorrect.  In 1991, <span fontStyle="italic">free elections ushered in former Prime Minister Nicephore Soglo as president</span>. Thus, it is true that <span fontStyle="italic">the country’s first president had previously served as its prime minister.</span></p>
