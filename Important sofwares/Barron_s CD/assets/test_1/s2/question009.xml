<p><span fontWeight="bold">was very little larger than a molecule.</span></p>
<p>The passage states that molecules are made of atoms; logically, therefore, an atom is smaller, not larger, than the molecule to which it belongs.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Had not yet been seen by the naked eye</span> is incorrect. This passage states atoms <span fontStyle="italic">have never been seen or photographed</span>.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Contained elements that were positively charged </span>is incorrect. This passage mentions the presence of positive electrical elements.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Followed experimentally determinable processes </span>is incorrect. This passage notes the ingenious laboratory experiments that determine its operations or processes.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Was smaller than 1/125 millionth of an inch</span> is incorrect. This passage mentions the average diameter of a molecule is 1/125 millionth of an inch. Atoms are smaller yet.</p>
