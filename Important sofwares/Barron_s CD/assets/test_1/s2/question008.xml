<p><span fontWeight="bold">Choices 2 and 3</span>.</p>
<p><span fontStyle="italic">Emphasis on formal artistic criteria</span> is a likely characteristic of classicism.  The passage talks of the formal beauty that distinguishes the classical works of Dante and Virgil. Likewise, <span fontStyle="italic">meticulous planning of artistic works</span> is a likely characteristic of classicism. The passage talks of the carefully planned compositions of the classicist Dante; it also tells of the structurally flawed compositions of the romantic Goethe.</p>

<p>Choice 1 is incorrect. <span fontStyle="italic">Sensitivity toward emotional promptings</span> is characteristic of romanticism; it is an unlikely characteristic of classicism.</p>

<p>Choice 2 by itself is incorrect.  Although you are correct to infer that an<span fontStyle="italic"> emphasis on formal artistic criteria</span> is a likely characteristic of classicism, that inference is not the only inference you can draw from the passage.</p>

<p>Choices 2 and 3 are correct. An <span fontStyle="italic">emphasis on formal artistic criteria</span> is a likely characteristic of classicism. The passage talks of the formal beauty that distinguishes the classical words of Dante and Virgil. Likewise, the <span fontStyle="italic">meticulous planning of artistic works</span> is a likely characteristic of classicism. The passage talks of the carefully planned composition of the classicist Dante; it also tells of the structurally flawed composition of the romantic Goethe.</p>

<p>Choice 3 by itself is incorrect.  Although you are correct to infer that <span fontStyle="italic">meticulous planning of artistic works</span> is a likely characteristic of classicism, that inference is not the only inference you can draw from the passage.
