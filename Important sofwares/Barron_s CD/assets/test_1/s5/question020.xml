<p>If you use the counting principle, this question can be answered by simple arithmetic, which you should do with the calculator.</p>
<p>• License plates with three digits followed by two letters: there are 10 ways to choose each of the digits and 26 ways to choose each of the letters, so there are 10 × 10 × 10 × 26 × 26 = 676,000 plates in this format.</p>
<p>• License plates with three letters followed by two digits: again, there are 26 ways to choose each letter and 10 ways to choose each digit, so there are 26 × 26 × 26 × 10 x 10 = 1,757,600 plates in this format.</p>
<p>• Finally, there are 676,000 + 1,757,600 = 2,433,600 different plates that can be issued.</p>
