<p paragraphStartIndent="0" textIndent="0"><span>In the practice mode, you will have the option of marking questions that you can later return to. Once a section has been completed, youâ€™ll be given the opportunity to go through all of the questions or just the marked ones and make adjustments.  This function is not available in the timed mode.</span></p>
<p paragraphStartIndent="0" textIndent="10"><span></span></p>
<p><span>The model examinations are in the format of a complete test. Once you begin taking a test, you must complete it without closing the application. If you close the application during a test, you will have to start the test over.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>After completing the test, you will see a button on the right labeled </span><span fontWeight="bold">Continue</span><span>. When you click the button, you will be presented with an answer key on the left and a calculation of your score for the multiple-choice section near the middle of the screen. You will also be given the means of calculating your free-response score and a chart that lets you calculate your approximate GRE score. Each answer in the answer key can be clicked on to open the answer explanation window. </span></p>
