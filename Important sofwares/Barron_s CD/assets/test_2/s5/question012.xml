<p>In 50 minutes, 5 ร 50 = 250 liters of water flows through the faucet into the vat. Since at the end of the 50 minutes the vat is full, there are 60 liters of water in the vat and the other 250 &#8211; 60 = 190 liters left the vat through the drain. So, the rate of flow through the drain is 190 liters รท 50 minutes = 3.8 liters per minute.</p>
