<p>For each of the pairs of years in question, use the graph to approximate the ratio of Republican to Democratic receipts. For example, in 1981&#8211;82, Republican receipts were slightly over $200 million and Democratic receipts were about $40 million, a ratio of 5:1. The only two pairs of years in which the ratio was very close were 1987&#8211;88 and 1989&#8211;90; in both of those pairs of years the ratio was very nearly 2:1.</p>
