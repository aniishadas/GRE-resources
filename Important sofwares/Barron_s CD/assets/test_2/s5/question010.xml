<p><span fontWeight="bold">Choices 3 and 4</span></p>
<p lineHeight="32">First calculate each of the mode, median, and average.</p>
<p lineHeight="32">• The mode is 3, the number that appears most often.</p>
<p lineHeight="32">• The median of a set of 10 numbers is the average of the fifth and sixth numbers, when the data are written in increasing order. Here the fifth number is 4 and the sixth number is 7, and the average of 4 and 7 is 5.5.</p>
<p lineHeight="32">• The sum of the ten numbers is 55, so their average is 55 ÷ 10 = 5.5.</p>
<p></p>
<p lineHeight="32">Now just examine each statement independently and determine which ones are true.</p>
<p lineHeight="32">• The median and average are each 5.5. Choice 1 is false.</p>
<p lineHeight="32">• The median is 5.5 and the mode is 3. Choice 2 is false.</p>
<p lineHeight="32">• The mode is 3 and the average is 5.5. Choice 3 is true.</p>
<p lineHeight="32">• The average of the mean and the mode is the average of 5.5 and 3: <img dominantBaseline="ideographicCenter" source="assets/images/tst2_eqn_094.swf"/>, and 8.5 ÷ 2 = 4.25.</p>
<p lineHeight="32">Choice 4 is true.</p>
