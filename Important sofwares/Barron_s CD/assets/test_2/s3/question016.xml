<p><span fontWeight="bold">Choice 2 and Choice 3</span></p>
<p>The simplest way to check the truth of each statement is to make a chart comparing sales in 2008 and 2010.</p>
<p textAlign="center"><span fontWeight="bold">For each $100 of sales in each year.</span></p>
<p lineHeight="120%" textAlign="center"><img source="assets/images/tst2_s3_016.swf"/></p>
<p>From the chart we see that for every $21 of sales of TVs, there were $22.50 of sales of Computers. The first choice is false.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2010, the total sales in the three categories other than Miscellaneous was $85.50, so the sales of Miscellaneous items was $14.50. The second choice is true.</p>
<p>In 2008, the ratio of the sales of Kitchen Appliances to the sales of TVs was 40:20 = 2:1. In 2010, the ratio was 42:21 = 2:1. The third choice is true.</p>
<p>We know that twice as many laptops were sold than desktops, but without knowing the prices of laptops and desktop, we cannot determine how their sales compared. The fourth choice is false.</p>
