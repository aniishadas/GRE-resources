<p lineHeight="32"><span fontWeight="bold">2,434.5 or 2434.50</span></p>
<p lineHeight="32">Of Howard’s $467.14 pay that week, $175 was his base salary and $467.14 &#8211; $175 = $292.14 was the commission he earned.</p>
<p lineHeight="32">If <span fontStyle="italic">S</span> represents his sales, then 0.12<span fontStyle="italic">S</span> = 292.14 and so <span fontStyle="italic">S</span> = 292.14 ÷ 0.12 = 2434.5.</p>
