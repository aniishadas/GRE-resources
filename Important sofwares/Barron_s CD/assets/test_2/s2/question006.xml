<p><span fontWeight="bold">the implications of Austen’s attitude to</span></p>
<p><span fontWeight="bold">her work.</span></p>
<p>The opening paragraph describes Austen’s <span fontStyle="italic">attitude to</span> <span fontStyle="italic">her work</span>, citing the novelist’s self-deprecatory remarks and her preference for anonymity rather than fame. The second paragraph goes on to discuss the <span fontStyle="italic">implications</span> of Austen’s attitude: "Austen’s self-effacing anonymity and her modest description of her miniaturist art also imply a criticism, even a rejection, of the world at large."</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Jane Austen’s place in English literary history</span> is incorrect.  The passage does not discuss Austen’s place in English literary history.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">The customary denigration faced by literary women</span> is incorrect. While the quote from Brunton makes the point that literary women have faced denigration, that is not the focus of the passage as a whole.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Critical evaluations of the novels of Jane Austen</span> is incorrect. The passage fails to provide any critical evaluations of Austen’s novels.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Society’s rejection of professional women in the 18th and 19th centuries </span>is incorrect.  The passage focuses on Austen in particular, not on professional women in general.</p>
