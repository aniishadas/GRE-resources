<p><span fontWeight="bold">she wanted to create a safe niche for the exercise of her talents.</span></p>
<p>As the passage explicitly states, "Austen attempted through self-imposed novelistic limitations to define a secure place."  She did so because <span fontStyle="italic">she wanted to create a safe niche for the exercise of her talents.</span></p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">She had a limited degree of experience of fiction</span> is incorrect.  Nothing in the passage indicates that Austen had a limited degree of experience of fiction.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Her imagination was incapable of creating other worlds </span>is incorrect. Nothing in the passage indicates that Austenâ€™s imagination was incapable of creating other worlds.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Women in her time were prohibited from writing about significant topics </span>is incorrect.  Although women in her time certainly were not encouraged to write about significant topics, they were not actually prohibited from doing so.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">She did not wish to be acknowledged as an author</span> is incorrect.  Although Austen preferred anonymity to being publicly acknowledged as an author, that was not her reason for concentrating on a limited range of subjects.</p>
