<p>Not a few of Jane Austen’s personal acquaintances might have echoed Sir Samuel Egerton Brydges, who noticed that “she was fair and handsome, slight and elegant, but with cheeks a little too full, while never suspect[ing] that she was an authoress.”  For this novelist whose personal obscurity was more complete than that of any other famous writer was always quick to insist on either complete anonymity or on the propriety of her limited craft, her delight in delineating just “3 or 4 Families in a Country Village.”  With her self-deprecatory remarks about her inability to join “strong manly, spirited sketches, full of Variety and Glow,” with her “little bit (two inches wide) of Ivory,” Jane Austen perpetuated the belief among her friends that her art was just an accomplishment “by a lady,” if anything “rather too light and bright and sparkling.”  In this respect she resembled one of her favorite contemporaries, Mary Brunton, who would rather have “glid[ed] through the world unknown” rather than been “suspected of literary airs&#8212;to be shunned, as literary women are, by the more pretending of their own sex, and abhorred, as literary women are, by the more pretending of the other!&#8212;my dear, I would sooner exhibit as a ropedancer.”</p>

Yet, decorous though they might first seem, Austen’s self-effacing anonymity and her modest description of her miniaturist art also imply a criticism, even a rejection, of the world at large.  For, as Gaston Bachelard explains, the miniature “allows us to be world conscious at slight risk.”  While the creators of satirically conceived diminutive landscapes seem to see everything as small because they are themselves so grand, Austen’s analogy for her art&#8212;her “little bit (two inches wide) of Ivory”&#8212;suggests a fragility that reminds us of the risk and instability outside the fictional space.  Besides seeing her art metaphorically, as her critics would too, in relation to female arts severely devalued until quite recently (for painting on ivory was traditionally a “ladylike” occupation), Austen attempted through self-imposed novelistic limitations to define a secure place, even as she seemed to admit the impossibility of actually inhabiting such a small space with any degree of comfort.  And always, for Austen, it is women&#8212;because they are too vulnerable in the world at large&#8212;who must acquiesce in their own confinement, no matter how stifling it might be.</p></TextFlow>]]></barrons:passage>
