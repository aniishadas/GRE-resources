<p><span fontWeight="bold">Assertion followed by analysis</span>.</p>
<p>The opening sentence asserts that Austen’s friends would not have suspected that she was an authoress.  The remainder of the passage analyzes why Austen made little of her status as a writer.  Thus, the relationship of the first sentence to the rest of the paragraph is that of an <span fontStyle="italic">assertion followed by analysis</span>.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Specific instance followed by generalization</span>s is incorrect. What follows the opening sentence is an examination of the critical implications of Austen’s attitude towards her work.  One would not describe such a detailed examination as generalizations.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Objective statement followed by personal opinion </span>is incorrect. The author is not simply expressing a personal opinion. She is examining the critical implications of Austen’s attitude towards her work.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Quotation from an authority followed by conflicting views </span>is incorrect. While the opening sentence quotes Egerton, he is not necessarily an authority, and the remainder of the passage fails to present conflicting views.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Challenge followed by debate</span> is incorrect. The opening sentence is in no way a challenge.</p>
