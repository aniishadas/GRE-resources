<p>The key phrases here are <span fontStyle="italic">eager for precision </span>and <span fontStyle="italic">determined at all costs</span>. They suggest that the questions for which the curators seek answers are highly serious ones.  Indeed, they are <span fontStyle="italic">vexing</span> (troublesome; puzzling; highly annoying) questions in a field <span fontStyle="italic">notorious</span> (infamous)<span fontStyle="italic"> for</span> its frustrating puzzles.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Decimated by</span> is incorrect.

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Redundant</span> is incorrect. The key phrases here are <span fontStyle="italic">eager for precision </span>and determined <span fontStyle="italic">at all costs</span>. They suggest that the questions for which the curators seek answers are important questions, not <span fontStyle="italic">redundant</span> or unnecessary ones.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Rhetorical</span> is incorrect. The key phrases here are <span fontStyle="italic">eager for precision</span> and <span fontStyle="italic">determined at all costs</span>.
