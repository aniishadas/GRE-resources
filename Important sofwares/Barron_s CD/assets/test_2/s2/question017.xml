<p><span fontWeight="bold">qualified appreciation.</span></p>
<p>The author appreciates many aspects of Lind’s experiment (he enumerates its "obvious commendable features"). However, his <span fontStyle="italic">appreciation</span> is <span fontStyle="italic">qualified</span>: he limits his approbation, approving those aspects of the experiment that he finds commendable and pointing out other aspects of the experiment that do not meet with his approval.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Measured indignation</span> is incorrect. While the author does have some critical comments to make about Lind’s experiment, his attitude towards it is not one of <span fontStyle="italic">measured indignation</span> (restrained righteous anger).</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Wholehearted admiration</span> is incorrect. The author makes critical comments about Lind’s experiment. His attitude towards it is not one of <span fontStyle="italic">wholehearted admiration</span> (earnest approval).</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Resigned forebearance</span> is incorrect. While the author does have some critical comments to make about Lind’s experiment, his attitude towards it is not one of <span fontStyle="italic">resigned forbearance</span> (philosophical patient endurance).</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Fulsome adulation</span> is incorrect. The author makes critical comments about Lind’s experiment. His attitude towards it is not one of <span fontStyle="italic">fulsome adulation</span> (excessively overdone admiration).</p>
