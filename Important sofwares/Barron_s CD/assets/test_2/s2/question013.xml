<p><span fontWeight="bold">frenzied; unsettle.</span></p>
<p>Someone imperturbable is calm and composed. Even if the bidding at an auction became <span fontStyle="italic">frenzied</span> (frantic; highly agitated), that would not <span fontStyle="italic">unsettle</span> (ruffle; disturb) an imperturbable auctioneerâ€™s composure. Think of "unsettled sleep."</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Magnanimous</span> is incorrect. The bidding at an auction would be somewhat unlikely to be described as <span fontStyle="italic">magnanimous</span> (high-minded; noble).</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Sporadic</span> is incorrect. The key phrase here is <span fontStyle="italic">the most hectic of circumstances</span>. <span fontStyle="italic">Sporadic</span> (intermittent or infrequent) bidding would not be particularly hectic or frantic.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Ameliorate</span> is incorrect. The auctioneer prides himself on his <span fontStyle="italic">imperturbability</span>, his ability to maintain his composure under stressful conditions. He will not allow anything to shake his composure. <span fontStyle="italic">Ameliorate</span> (improve; make better) makes no sense in the context.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Denigrate</span> is incorrect. The auctioneer prides himself on his <span fontStyle="italic">imperturbability</span>, his ability to maintain his composure under stressful conditions. He will not allow anything to shake his composure. <span fontStyle="italic">Denigrate</span> (disparage; defame) makes no sense in the context.</p>
