<p><span fontWeight="bold">charge; carp.</span></p>
<p>The critics <span fontStyle="italic">charge</span> (make the accusation) or <span fontStyle="italic">carp</span> (find fault; grumble) 
that Perry has published only anecdotes of his observations and has not published any detailed analyses.  The key phrase here is <span fontStyle="italic">rather than</span>.  It signals that there is a contrast between what Perry’s critics would have wanted him to publish ("carefully documented case studies in technical journals") and what he has actually published ("anecdotes in popular magazines").</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Intimate</span> is incorrect.  To <span fontStyle="italic">intimate</span> is to hint or suggest.  It makes no sense in the context.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Applaud</span> is incorrect.  The scientists are critical of Perry; they are not <span fontStyle="italic">applauding</span> that their colleague’s observations have been reported as anecdotes.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Theorize</span> is incorrect.  Perry’s critics are not <span fontStyle="italic">theorizing</span> (speculating; conjecturing) about a possibility; they are criticizing something that has gone on for over a decade.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Apologize</span> is incorrect.  The scientists are critical of Perry; they are not <span fontStyle="italic">apologizing</span> for their colleague.</p>
