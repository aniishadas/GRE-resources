<p><span fontWeight="bold">inherent opposition.</span></p>
<p>The author says that the tendency for a government to encroach upon individual liberty to the extent to which it has the power to do so is "almost a natural law" of politics. Thus, government and individual liberty are <span fontStyle="italic">inherently</span> by their very natures in <span fontStyle="italic">opposition</span> to one another.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Marked indifference</span> is incorrect. To describe the relationship between government and individual liberty as one of <span fontStyle="italic">marked indifference</span> (pronounced lack of interest) makes no sense.</p>
   
<p><span fontStyle="italic">Secret collusion</span> is incorrect. To describe the relationship between government and individual liberty as one of <span fontStyle="italic">secret collusion</span> (hidden conspiracy) makes no sense.</p>
   
<p><span fontStyle="italic">Moderate complicity</span> is incorrect. To describe the relationship between government and individual liberty as one of <span fontStyle="italic">moderate complicity</span> (limited involvement in wrongdoing) makes no sense.</p>
   
<p><span fontStyle="italic">Fundamental interdependence</span> is incorrect. The author is not describing the relationship between government and individual liberty as one of <span fontStyle="italic">fundamental interdependence</span> (an essential</p>
<p>mutual reliance).</p>
