<p><span fontWeight="bold">Choices 1 and 3.</span></p>
<p>Both statements support the author’s view.</p>

<p>Choice 1 by itself is incorrect. It strengthens the conclusion by giving evidence of corporate influence in an area not dealt with in the argument and thus supports the author’s views. However, choice 1 is not the <span fontStyle="italic">only</span> statement that would support the author’s views.</p>

<p>Choice 2 is incorrect.  The fact that <span fontStyle="italic">Growing numbers of the most talented college graduates</span> are <span fontStyle="italic">choosing to work for private corporations rather than for the government or the non-profit sector </span>is unrelated to either the evidence or the conclusion.</p>

<p>Choice 3 by itself is incorrect.  It strengthens the evidence by giving additional data suggesting corporate autonomy and thus supports the author’s views. However, Choice 3 is not the <span fontStyle="italic">only</span> statement that would support the author’s views.</p>
