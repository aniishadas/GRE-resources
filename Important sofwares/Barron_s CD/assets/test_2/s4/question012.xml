<p><span fontWeight="bold">meticulous about; economy; scrupulous.</span></p>
<p>The key phrase here that unlocks the entire sentence is <span fontStyle="italic">the chief executive officer was far more liberal in his spending habits</span>. That is your clue that the second missing word is <span fontStyle="italic">economy</span> (thriftiness). The CFO is known for thriftiness and for being <span fontStyle="italic">meticulous</span> (thorough; painstaking)<span fontStyle="italic"> about</span> keeping accurate records. In contrast, the CEO is known for being a free spender and for <span fontStyle="italic">not</span> being <span fontStyle="italic">scrupulous</span> (conscientious; thorough) about keeping good records.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Overwhelmed by</span> is incorrect. Nothing suggests that keeping accurate records would have</p>
<p><span fontStyle="italic">overwhelmed </span>the CFO.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Restricted to</span> is incorrect. It makes little sense to say that the CFO was <span fontStyle="italic">restricted</span> (limited) to keeping</p>
<p>accurate records.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Meekness</span> is incorrect. Nothing suggests the CFO was famous for <span fontStyle="italic">meekness</span> (humbleness; timidity).</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Eccentricity</span> is incorrect. Nothing suggests the CFO was famous for <span fontStyle="italic">eccentricity</span> (oddness; peculiarity).</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Intuitive</span> is incorrect. <span fontStyle="italic">Intuitive</span> (innately perceptive) makes no sense in the context of record-keeping.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Manifest</span> is incorrect.  <span fontStyle="italic">Manifest</span> (evident; obvious) makes no sense in the context.</p>
