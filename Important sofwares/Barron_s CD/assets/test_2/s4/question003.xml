<p>Read the sentence and try to come up with your own word to fill the blank.  Although she had to <span fontStyle="italic">admit</span> that her nephew was slow, she was reluctant to do so. She did not wish to <span fontStyle="italic">acknowledge</span> or <span fontStyle="italic">concede</span> that he was thick as a plank.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Relinquish</span> is incorrect. <span fontStyle="italic">Relinquish</span> (surrender; release) makes no sense in the context.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Approve</span> is incorrect. <span fontStyle="italic">Approve</span> makes no sense in the context.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Instigate</span> is incorrect. <span fontStyle="italic">Instigate</span> (provoke; incite) makes no sense in the context.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Waive</span> is incorrect. <span fontStyle="italic">Waive</span> (refrain from claiming; put aside) makes no sense in the context.</p>
