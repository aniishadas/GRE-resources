<p><span fontWeight="bold">They mark a regression to earlier despotic forms of government.</span></p>
<p>If the fascist dictatorships "are the first truly tyrannical governments that Western Europe has known for centuries, "then it can be inferred that, centuries ago, tyrannical or <span fontStyle="italic">despotic</span> governments existed in Western Europe. Thus, the fascist governments represent a <span fontStyle="italic">regression</span> or reversion to an earlier form of government.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">They represent a more efficient form of the executive </span>is incorrect. Nothing in the passage suggests that fascist governments <span fontStyle="italic">represent a more efficient form of the executive.</span></p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">They rose to power through an accident of history</span> is incorrect. Nothing in the passage suggests that fascist governments <span fontStyle="italic">rose to power through an accident of history.
</span></p>
<p><span fontStyle="italic">	Despite superficial dissimilarities, they are in essence like absolute monarchies</span> is incorrect. The powers of the monarchies, though absolute in theory, in practice were checked or restrained; the powers of the fascist dictatorships were not. Thus, the two forms of government were fundamentally different.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">	They maintain their dominance by rechanneling opposing forces in new directions</span> is incorrect.  Nothing in the passage suggests that fascist governments <span fontStyle="italic">maintain their dominance by rechanneling opposing forces in new directions.</span></p>
