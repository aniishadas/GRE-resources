<p><span fontWeight="bold">It has made them particularly tempting to human predators.</span></p>
<p>Fat storage "has rebounded" or worked against the fat mouse’s survival because it has led to the mouse’s being considered a succulent delicacy by African hunters. In other words, <span fontStyle="italic">it has made them particularly tempting to human predators.</span></p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">It has enabled them to go without food and water for long periods of time </span>is incorrect.  "Has rebounded" here means "has boomeranged" or "has backfired." In other words, fat storage, which had helped fat mice to survive, has now become a threat to their survival. The ability to go without food and water for long periods of time would not be a threat to their survival.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">It has made them so spherical that they cannot move readily</span> is incorrect. Nothing in the passage suggests that fat storage has made them so spherical that they cannot move readily.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">It has caused them to adopt abnormal patterns of sleep</span> is incorrect. Nothing in the passage suggests that fat storage has caused them to adopt abnormal patterns of sleep.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">It has made them susceptible to extremes in temperature</span> is incorrect. Nothing in the passage suggests that fat storage has made them susceptible to extremes in temperature.</p>
