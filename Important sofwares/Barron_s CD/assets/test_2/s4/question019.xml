<barrons:explanation>
<![CDATA[<TextFlow xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/textLayout/2008">
<p><span fontWeight="bold">Choice 1.</span></p>
<p>In the first sentence, the author asserts that it was risky for a politician to introduce federal gun legislation. The second sentence provides background for this assertion, giving details that amplify and support the author’s statement. Thus, the first sentence <span fontStyle="italic">introduces a view that the succeeding sentence will help support</span>.</p>

<p>Choice 2 is incorrect. Nothing in the second sentence <span fontStyle="italic">refutes</span> or disproves the assertion made in the first sentence.</p>
   
<p>Choice 3 is incorrect. The first sentence does not raise a question.</p>
