<p><span fontStyle="italic">Skeptical disbelief</span> is incorrect. The author is not <span fontStyle="italic">skeptical</span> or incredulous about the way the mouse has been treated</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Grudging admiration</span> is incorrect. While the author may well admire the experiment he cites, nothing in the passage suggest that his admiration is <span fontStyle="italic">grudging</span> or reluctant.</p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Marked disapprobation</span> is incorrect. Nothing in the passage suggests that the author disapproves of the experiment. His attitude is not one of <span fontStyle="italic">marked disapprobation</span>.</p>
