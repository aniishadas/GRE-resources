<p><span fontWeight="bold">eradicating all potential opposition.</span></p>
<p>The final sentence states that the fascist dictatorships "destroyed all forms of social organization that were in any way rivals to the state." In doing so, they were <span fontStyle="italic">eradicating all potential opposition.</span></p>

<p><span fontStyle="italic">Setting limits to their scope of action</span> is incorrect. Social classes, such as the feudal nobility in England, and organized corporations, such as the guilds and trade unions, were able to set limits to their respective governmentâ€™s scope of action. The fascist dictatorships set no such limits on their powers.</p>
   
<p><span fontStyle="italic">Enjoying economic power and popular support</span> is incorrect. Nothing in the passage indicates that fascist dictatorships differ from monarchies in <span fontStyle="italic">enjoying economic power and popular support.</span></p>
   
<p><span fontStyle="italic">Rivaling the state in power</span> is incorrect. It is unsupported by the passage.</p>
   
<p><span fontStyle="italic">Defending itself from arbitrary rulings</span> is incorrect. It is unsupported by the passage.</p>
