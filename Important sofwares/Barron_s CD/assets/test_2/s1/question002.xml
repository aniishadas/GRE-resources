			<p></p>
<p>"A novel therapy has come to our attention that promises to significantly decrease the incidence of dementia in our aging community.  According to a 21-year study led by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and funded by the National Institute on Aging, while many physical activities like playing tennis or golf, swimming, bicycling, dancing, and walking for exercise provided cardiovascular benefits for seniors, only one physical activity offered protection against dementia: that was frequent dancing.
At GoldenAge we currently provide residents with extensive recreational facilities.  These include tennis courts, a fitness center, and lap pools in each senior apartment complex.  However, we have no dance studio space at GoldenAge, nor any social dance programs.</p>
<p>Clearly, social dancing can prevent or delay the onset of dementia. Since the onset of dementia inevitably signals the imminent move of residents from our independent living apartments to the more heavily staffed and therefore more costly to operate assisted living quarters, we recommend the establishment of social dance programs at all GoldenAge senior residencesâ€”as a cost-effective, positive way to ward off dementia and enable our residents to remain in their independent living quarters."</p>

<p>Respond by writing an essay in which you discuss the specific evidence you would need to judge the validity of the argument and explain how this evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.</p>
